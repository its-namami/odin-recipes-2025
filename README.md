    <summary>What do I hope to gain with this project</summary>
    <dl>
        <dt>Git Experience</dt>
        <dd>Specifically I want to, from this point onward, only do good commits that are very easily readable and maintainable</dd>
        <dt>HTML and CSS</dt>
        <dd>I have, dare I say, a decent amount of knowledge of HTML and CSS, and with me reading a bit more these days, I feel like I now know even more. But it's important for me to keep practicing &ndsh; just today I had run my HTML code *(shayhowe repository)* through a validator, and installed a VS Code plugin, even though I use nvim, I just don't know how to set up a plug in, but yeah that's kinda it</dd>
